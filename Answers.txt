q: What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
- parameters are the name within the function definition.
- Parameters donâ€™t change when the program is running
- Parameters don't necessarily be always defined in python
- Arguments are the values passed in when the function is called.
- Arguments are probably going to be different every time the function is called.


q: Make a program that asks the users preferred programming language.
a: input("Enter your preferred programming language: ")

q: Make a program that displays the lyrics of a song.
a: import spotipy
   import spotipy.util as util
   from config.config import USERNAME, SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID, SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET, SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI
   scope = 'user-read-currently-playing'
   token = util.prompt_for_user_token(
      USERNAME, scope, client_id=SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID, client_secret=SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET, redirect_uri=SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI)
   if token:
      sp = spotipy.Spotify(auth=token)
      current_song = sp.currently_playing()
      artist = current_song['item']['artists'][0]['name']
      name_song = current_song['item']['name']
      print(artist, name_song)
    else:
      print("Can't get token for", USERNAME)



q: Make a program to calulate the percentage of students
a:  
eng, Islam, Maths=-5, -6, -8
TotalMarks=300
percent= (eng+lslam+Maths) / TotalMarks *100
if percent<100 and percent>80:
   print("Grade A+")
elif percent<80 and percent>70:
   print("Grade A")
elif percent<70 and percent>60:
   print("Grade B")
elif percent<60 and percent>50:
   print("Grade C")
elif percent<50 and percent>40:
   print("Grade D")
elif percent<40 and percent>30:
   print("Grade E")
elif percent>0 and percent<30:
   print(" Fail" )
elif percent>100:
   print("percent can't be greater than 100! ")
elif percent<0:
   print("percent can't be negative!")
else:
   print("Something wrong!)


q:Is python open source language?

q: What is a syntax error?

}
}

q: What is a syntax error?
